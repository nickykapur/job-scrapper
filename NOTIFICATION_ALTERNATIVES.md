# Notification Alternatives

Since GitHub and Discord notifications don't work well for you, here are other options:

---

## ✅ Option 1: No Notifications (Simplest)

**How it works:**
- Scraper runs automatically 7 times per day
- No notifications sent
- Check results manually when convenient

**To check results:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/nickykapur/job-scrapper/actions
2. See latest run status (✅ or ❌)
3. Click on run to see details

**Or check your frontend:**
- Visit: https://web-production-110bb.up.railway.app
- Refresh to see new jobs

**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero setup
- ✅ No notification spam
- ✅ Already working

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Have to check manually
- ⚠️ Don't know if scraper fails

---

## 📱 Option 2: Telegram (Most Reliable)

**Why Telegram:**
- ✅ Push notifications work PERFECTLY on iPhone
- ✅ Free forever
- ✅ No server needed
- ✅ Very simple API
- ✅ Works even in China

**Setup (3 minutes):**

1. Install Telegram from App Store
2. Message @BotFather on Telegram
3. Send: `/newbot`
4. Follow prompts to create bot
5. Copy bot token (looks like: `1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`)
6. Message your bot (send any text)
7. Visit: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
8. Look for `"chat":{"id":123456789}` - that's your chat ID
9. Add to GitHub Secrets:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your bot token
   - `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: Your chat ID

**Then I'll update the workflow to send to Telegram instead.**

**What you'll get:**
```
✅ Ireland: 23 jobs
✅ Spain: 15 jobs
...
🎉 Complete! Total: 5,234 jobs
```

## 📧 Option 3: Email (Simple but Delayed)

2. Click "Watch" → "Custom"

**Or use SendGrid for rich emails:**

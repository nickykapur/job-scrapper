# Germany Scraping Configuration

## Summary of Changes

Germany has been **re-enabled** in the multi-country scraping system with intelligent filtering to ensure only suitable jobs are collected.

## What Changed

### 1. **Added Germany to Countries List**
- Location: Berlin, Germany
- Now scraping 4 countries: Ireland, Spain, UK, and **Germany**

### 2. **German Language Filter**
A sophisticated filter has been implemented to **exclude jobs requiring proficient German**:

**Filters out jobs with these requirements:**
- "Fluent German" / "Fluent in German"
- "German proficiency" / "Proficient in German"
- "Native German speaker"
- "Fließend Deutsch" (Fluent German in German)
- "Deutsch als Muttersprache" (German as native language)
- "Verhandlungssicher Deutsch" (Business-level German)
- "C1/C2 level German"
- "German is required/mandatory/essential"
- "Must speak/know German"
- "Advanced German" / "Excellent German"
- "Sehr gute Deutschkenntnisse" (Very good German skills)

**Keeps jobs that:**
- Only mention Germany as a location
- List German as "nice to have" or "a plus"
- Have no language requirements
- Only require English

### 3. **Job Limits Per Country**
Per scraping session:
- **Ireland: UNLIMITED** - All jobs from the session are kept
- **Spain, UK, Germany: 20 jobs each** - Only the 20 most recent per country
- This keeps the database lean while ensuring Ireland gets full coverage

### 4. **Experience Filter (Already Existed)**
Continues to filter out jobs requiring:
- 5+ years of experience
- Senior/Lead/Principal/Staff positions
- Architect roles

## Testing

The German language filter has been tested with 10 different scenarios:
```bash
python3 test_german_filter.py
```

**Test Results:** ✅ 10/10 passed

## How It Works

### Daily Scraping Flow:
1. **GitHub Actions** triggers at 9 AM, 11 AM, 1 PM, 3 PM, 4 PM, 6 PM, 8 PM (Dublin time)
2. Scraper searches for software jobs in:
   - Dublin, Ireland
   - Madrid, Spain
   - London, UK
   - **Berlin, Germany** (NEW)
3. For **each country**, applies filters:
   - Experience filter (removes 5+ years requirements)
   - **German language filter (only for Germany jobs)**
4. Keeps only **20 most recent jobs per country**
5. Syncs to Railway database
6. Your dashboard updates automatically

### What You'll See:
- **Ireland jobs**: All jobs found in each scraping session (unlimited)
- **German jobs**: Up to 20 that don't require proficient German
- **Spain & UK jobs**: Up to 20 most recent each
- **Junior-friendly** positions (no 5+ years requirement)
- **English-speaking roles** across all countries

## Expected Results

### Before:
- No German jobs in database
- OR Too many German jobs with language requirements

### After:
- **~20 German jobs** that don't require German fluency
- English-speaking roles from Berlin
- International companies in Germany
- Entry/mid-level positions

## Files Modified

1. **`daily_multi_country_update.py`**
   - Added `filter_german_language_requirement()` function (line 205)
   - Added Germany to `countries_config` (line 303)
   - Updated filtering logic to apply German filter (line 367)
   - Changed job limit from 300 to 20 (line 403)

2. **`.github/workflows/daily-scraper.yml`**
   - Updated comments to reflect Germany scraping
   - Documented 20 job limit per country

3. **`test_german_filter.py`** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive test suite for German language filter
   - 10 test cases covering various scenarios

## Monitoring

### Check if it's working:
```bash
# View jobs by country
python3 -c "import json; data = json.load(open('jobs_database.json')); print(f\"Germany: {len([j for j in data.values() if isinstance(j, dict) and j.get('country') == 'Germany'])} jobs\")"

# Run analytics
python3 analyze_scraping_stats.py 7  # Last 7 days
```

### Expected output:
```
Ireland: 50-200 jobs (unlimited)
Spain: ~20 jobs
UK: ~20 jobs
Germany: ~20 jobs
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Too many German jobs with language requirements"
- The filter patterns may need updating
- Run `test_german_filter.py` to verify filter works
- Check job descriptions manually to identify new patterns

### "No German jobs at all"
- Check if GitHub Actions is running successfully
- Verify Berlin jobs exist on LinkedIn
- Check filter isn't too aggressive

### "Getting more than 20 jobs per country"
- The `limit_jobs_per_country()` function should handle this
- Check line 403 in `daily_multi_country_update.py`

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
1. Add more German cities (Munich, Frankfurt, Hamburg)
2. Fine-tune language filter based on real results
3. Track German job trends separately
4. Add "German level required" field to job data

## Quick Reference

**Test the filter:**
```bash
python3 test_german_filter.py
```

**Run manual scrape:**
```bash
python3 daily_multi_country_update.py
```

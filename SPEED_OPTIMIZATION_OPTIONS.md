# GitHub Actions Speed Optimization Options

## Current Performance
- **Time:** 34 minutes per run
- **Searches:** 7 countries × 25 terms = 175 searches
- **Runs:** 7 times per day
- **Monthly usage:** 34 min × 7 × 30 = 7,140 minutes

---

## Option 1: Parallel Execution ⚡ **FASTEST**

**Speed:** 5-7 minutes (85% faster)
**File:** `.github/workflows/parallel-scraper.yml` (created)

### How it works:
- Runs all 7 countries simultaneously using GitHub Actions matrix
- Each country takes 5 minutes = total 5-7 minutes

### Pros:
- ✅ Fastest option (85% reduction)
- ✅ No code changes to scraper
- ✅ Most reliable

### Cons:
- ❌ Uses 7× minutes (7 jobs × 5 min = 35 minutes per run)
- ❌ Monthly: 35 min × 7 runs × 30 days = **7,350 minutes/month**
- ❌ Exceeds free tier (2,000 min/month) - would need paid plan

### Cost:
- Free tier: 2,000 minutes/month
- Overage: 5,350 minutes × $0.008 = **$42.80/month**

### To use:
```bash
# Disable old workflow
git mv .github/workflows/daily-scraper.yml .github/workflows/daily-scraper.yml.disabled

# Enable parallel workflow (already created)
git add .github/workflows/parallel-scraper.yml
git add daily_single_country_scraper.py
git commit -m "Enable parallel scraping for 5-minute execution"
git push
```

## Option 2: Reduce Search Terms 📉 **SIMPLE**

**Speed:** 15-18 minutes (50% faster)
**Complexity:** Low

### Changes:
Reduce from 25 to 12 search terms by combining similar ones:

**Software (9 → 5 terms):**
- "Software Engineer" (catches "Junior Software Engineer")
- "Python Developer"
- "React Developer"
- "Full Stack Developer" (catches Backend/Frontend)
- "JavaScript Developer" (catches Node.js)

**HR (16 → 7 terms):**
- "HR Officer" (catches HR Coordinator/Assistant/Specialist)
- "Talent Acquisition" (catches Coordinator/Specialist)
- "Recruiter" (catches Junior Recruiter/Recruitment Coordinator)
- "HR Generalist"
- "People Operations" (catches People Partner)
- "HR Manager" (catches Talent Manager)
- "HR Business Partner"

### Pros:
- ✅ Simple change
- ✅ 50% faster
- ✅ Stays within free tier
- ✅ Still catches most relevant jobs (LinkedIn shows similar results)

### Cons:
- ⚠️ Might miss some niche jobs

### Monthly usage:
- 18 min × 7 runs × 30 days = **3,780 minutes/month** (still over free tier)

---

## Option 3: Reduce Scrolling/Jobs 🔽 **BALANCED**

**Speed:** 20-22 minutes (35% faster)
**Complexity:** Low

### Changes:
- Reduce `max_scrolls` from 5 to 2 (gets first 10-15 jobs instead of 25+)
- Reduces time per search from 12s to 8s

### Pros:
- ✅ Easy to implement
- ✅ Most recent jobs still captured (24h filter)
- ✅ Can combine with Option 2

### Cons:
- ⚠️ Fewer jobs per search

### To implement:
```python
# In linkedin_job_scraper.py line 735
max_scrolls = 2  # Changed from 5
```

### Monthly usage:
- 22 min × 7 runs × 30 days = **4,620 minutes/month** (still over free tier)

---

## Option 4: Reduce Frequency 📅 **COST SAVING**

**Speed:** Same (34 min)
**Runs:** 3× daily instead of 7×

### Changes:
```yaml
# In .github/workflows/daily-scraper.yml
- cron: '0 9,13,18 * * *'  # 9 AM, 1 PM, 6 PM only
```

### Pros:
- ✅ Zero code changes
- ✅ Within free tier
- ✅ Still gets fresh jobs 3x daily

### Cons:
- ⚠️ Less frequent updates

### Monthly usage:
- 34 min × 3 runs × 30 days = **3,060 minutes/month** (still over free tier)

---

## Option 5: Combined Approach 🎯 **RECOMMENDED**

**Speed:** 8-10 minutes (70% faster)
**Monthly usage:** 1,800 minutes (within free tier!)

### Combine:
1. Reduce search terms (25 → 12)
2. Reduce scrolling (5 → 2)
3. Reduce frequency (7 → 4 runs daily)

### Changes:
- 12 search terms × 7 countries = 84 searches
- 8s per search = 672s = 11 minutes
- Run at: 9 AM, 1 PM, 4 PM, 8 PM (4× daily)

### Pros:
- ✅ 70% faster execution
- ✅ **Within GitHub free tier!**
- ✅ Still gets jobs 4× daily
- ✅ Best balance of speed + coverage

### Monthly usage:
- 11 min × 4 runs × 30 days = **1,320 minutes/month** ✅

---

## Option 6: Move to Railway Cron ☁️ **ALTERNATIVE**

**Use Railway's built-in cron instead of GitHub Actions**

### Pros:
- ✅ No GitHub Actions minutes used
- ✅ Runs on same server as database (faster)

### Cons:
- ❌ Railway doesn't have generous free tier for compute
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Harder to debug

## My Recommendation: Option 5 (Combined Approach)

This gives you:
- **70% faster** (11 min vs 34 min)
- **Within free tier** (1,320 / 2,000 minutes)
- **4× daily updates** (still plenty)
- **Good job coverage** (reduced but smart search terms)

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Reduce search terms in `daily_multi_country_update.py`**
2. **Reduce scrolling in `linkedin_job_scraper.py`**
3. **Update cron schedule in `.github/workflows/daily-scraper.yml`**

Would you like me to implement Option 5 (Combined Approach)?

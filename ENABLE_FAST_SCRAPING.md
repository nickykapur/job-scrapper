# Enable Fast Parallel Scraping (5-7 minutes)

## 🎉 Good News: Your Public Repo Gets UNLIMITED Minutes!

Since your repository is **public**, GitHub gives you **unlimited GitHub Actions minutes** on public runners!

This means you can use **parallel execution** for FREE to reduce scraping time from **34 minutes to 5-7 minutes** (85% faster).

## How It Works

**Old (Sequential):** 34 minutes
```
Ireland → Spain → Panama → Chile → Netherlands → Germany → Sweden
   ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓         ↓           ↓          ↓
 5 min    5 min    5 min    5 min     5 min       5 min      5 min
= 34 minutes total
```

**New (Parallel):** 5-7 minutes
```
Ireland  ┐
Spain    ├─── All running at the same time
Panama   ├─── Each takes 5 minutes
Chile    ├─── Total time = 5-7 minutes
Neth.    │
Germany  │
Sweden   ┘
```

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Commit All Current Changes

First, let's commit the fixes we've made (HR filtering, migration, optimization):

```bash
git add linkedin_job_scraper.py railway_server.py daily_multi_country_update.py
git commit -m "Fix HR job filtering and optimize database cleanup"
git push
```

### Step 2: Disable Old Workflow

```bash
# Rename to disable it
git mv .github/workflows/daily-scraper.yml .github/workflows/daily-scraper.yml.disabled
```

### Step 3: Enable Parallel Workflow

```bash
# The parallel workflow is already created
git add .github/workflows/parallel-scraper.yml
git add daily_single_country_scraper.py
git add ENABLE_FAST_SCRAPING.md

git commit -m "Enable parallel scraping (5-7 min execution)"
git push
```

### Step 4: Test It!

```bash
# Manually trigger the workflow to test
# Go to: https://github.com/nickykapur/job-scrapper/actions
# Click on "Parallel Job Scraper (Fast)"
# Click "Run workflow" button
```

---

## What Changes?

### Files Added:
1. **`.github/workflows/parallel-scraper.yml`** - New parallel workflow
2. **`daily_single_country_scraper.py`** - Single country scraper

### Files Modified:
- None! The parallel approach uses the same scraper logic

### Files Disabled:
- **`.github/workflows/daily-scraper.yml`** → `.github/workflows/daily-scraper.yml.disabled`

---

## Monitoring

### GitHub Actions Dashboard:
https://github.com/nickykapur/job-scrapper/actions

You'll see:
- **7 parallel jobs** running simultaneously
- Each job labeled by country (Ireland, Spain, etc.)
- Total time: **5-7 minutes**
- All jobs complete around the same time

### Logs:
Each country will have its own log showing:
- Searches performed (25 search terms)
- Jobs found
- Upload status

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you want to go back to the old sequential workflow:

```bash
# Re-enable old workflow
git mv .github/workflows/daily-scraper.yml.disabled .github/workflows/daily-scraper.yml

# Disable parallel workflow
git mv .github/workflows/parallel-scraper.yml .github/workflows/parallel-scraper.yml.disabled

git commit -m "Rollback to sequential scraping"
git push
```

## Cost Analysis

| Approach | Time | Monthly Minutes | Cost (Public Repo) |
|----------|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Old (Sequential)** | 34 min | 7,140 min/month | FREE |
| **New (Parallel)** | 5-7 min | 7,350 min/month | FREE |

**Result:** Same cost (FREE), 85% faster execution! 🚀

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Not enough runners available"
- GitHub might queue jobs if all runners are busy
- This is rare and usually resolves in 1-2 minutes

### Problem: "One country failed"
- Set `fail-fast: false` ensures other countries continue
- Failed country can be re-run manually

### Problem: "Database conflicts"
- Each country uploads independently
- Railway handles concurrent writes automatically
- Cleanup job runs after all uploads complete

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Commit current changes (HR filtering, optimization)
2. ✅ Disable old workflow
3. ✅ Enable parallel workflow
4. ✅ Test with manual trigger
5. ✅ Monitor first automated run
